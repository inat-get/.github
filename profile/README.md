# INat::Get Project

*CLI tool for downloading and analyzing iNaturalist biodiversity data*

`inat-get` is a command-line interface for working with iNaturalist data, implemented in Ruby. The tool enables users to programmatically retrieve observation records from the iNaturalist platform and process them for research and analysis purposes.

Key capabilities include downloading observations based on taxonomic, geographic, and temporal filters; exporting data in multiple formats for integration with analytical workflows; and generating summary statistics from biodiversity datasets. `inat-get` is designed to facilitate reproducible data collection from iNaturalist, supporting research in ecology, conservation biology, phenology, and related fields.
